# Movie Genre Classificatoin

## Goal

This project aims to predict the genre of movie accurately.
## Methodology

Utilizing a combination of EDA techniques and machine learning algorithms, we have meticulously analyzed data to discern patterns and correlations associated with the description of each movie . Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualization to extract meaningful insights.
## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Stop words removal
2. Lemmatization i.e spliting words into ins similar root words
3. Vectorization using TF-IDF used to give numeric values to words based on their similarity
## Model Utilized
Linear SVC
## Libraries Used

1. numpy: For efficient numerical operations
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
3. seaborn: For visually appealing statistical graphics
4. matplotlib: For comprehensive data visualization
5. Sklearn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
## Results
94% Accuracy

## Conclusion
Through LinearSVC model high predictive accuracy has been achieved for Movie Genre Classificaton.
