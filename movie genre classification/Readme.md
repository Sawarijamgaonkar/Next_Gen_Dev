# Movie Genre Classificatoin

## Goal

This project aims to predict the genre of movie accurately.
## Methodology

Utilizing a combination of EDA techniques and machine learning algorithms, we have meticulously analyzed data to discern patterns and correlations associated with the description of each movie . Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualization to extract meaningful insights.
## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Stop words removal
2. Lemmatization/Stemming
3. Vectorization using TF-IDF
## Models Utilized
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. LinearSVC
4. Multinomial Naive Bayes
## Libraries Used

1. numpy: For efficient numerical operations
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
3. seaborn: For visually appealing statistical graphics
4. matplotlib: For comprehensive data visualization
5. Sklearn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
## Results
1. Logistic Regression : 69%
2. Random Forest Regressor : 42%
3. LinearSVC : 94%
4. Multinomial Naive Bayes : 46%

## Conclusion
Through rigorous analysis and experimentation, it has been determined that LinearSVC model exhibit the highest predictive accuracy for Movie Genre Classificaton.
